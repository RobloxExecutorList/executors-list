## Overview

Codex uses an external injector that mimics Hyperion‚Äôs handshake, keeping kernel-mode checks quiet while still exposing deep calls like `getgenv`, `firesignal`, and decompiler access. 
Because it‚Äôs keyless, you jump straight from launch to attach‚Äîno copy-and-paste loops. 
The cloud updater checks offsets every boot and usually patches within minutes of a Roblox update, so sideline time is nearly zero. 
Mobile players run the same interface inside the Android and iOS builds, giving couch-side script control with full feature parity.
