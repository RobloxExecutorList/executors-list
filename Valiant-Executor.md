## Overview

Valiant’s lean C++ core writes straight into corescripts in RAM, dodging Byfron’s static scans while sparing you **any** key-gate purgatory. 
A built-in auto-patcher checks cloud hooks every launch, so when Roblox pushes a stealth hotfix at dawn, Valiant side-steps before your kettle whistles. 
The devs baked in rich UI customisation; swap themes, animate panels, or even splash bespoke XAML code to make the injector feel like *your* cockpit. 
Mobile grinders aren’t left out—community lists rank Valiant among the top phone-friendly executors thanks to its featherweight DLL and emulator swagger.
