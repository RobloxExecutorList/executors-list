## Overview

Delta‚Äôs external injector mimics Hyperion‚Äôs kernel handshake, letting deep calls‚Äî`getgenv`, `firesignal`, full decompile‚Äîslip past current Byfron checks.  A bite-size key flow (one Work.ink pass, valid for 24 h) means no endless captcha chains.  The cloud updater pings new offsets every boot and usually patches within minutes of a Roblox update, slashing downtime.  Mobile parity lets couch-side grinders use the same UI on Android or side-loaded iOS.
