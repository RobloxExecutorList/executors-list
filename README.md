## üß† What Are Script Executors?

Roblox executors are external injectors or interpreters that let you run custom Lua scripts inside Roblox games.  
They attach to the client, bypass anti-cheats like **Byfron/Hyperion**, and unlock high-level functions such as:

- `getgenv`, `firetouchinterest`, `getconnections`
- Autofarm, ESP, aimbot, noclip
- Full script decompilation (Level 8+)

## üß© Key Features Explained

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Execution Level** | Level 8 = access to private functions and full introspection |
| **Key System** | Keyless tools save time‚Äîno linkvertise captchas or gateway chains |
| **UNC Score** | High % = better compatibility with community scripts |
| **Update Speed** | Tools with cloud auto-patching survive Roblox updates faster |
| **Platform** | PC is standard; mobile/mac support is a bonus |
| **Script Hub** | Injectors with built-in hubs (e.g., ScriptBlox) offer one-tap ESP, autofarm, and more |

## üõ°Ô∏è Use At Your Own Risk

Using any Roblox executor **can lead to permanent bans**.  
If you're experimenting, always:

- Use alternate accounts  
- Never inject while logged into limiteds  
- Whitelist your executor folders to avoid antivirus false positives  
- Download only from official GitHub or Discord channels listed inside each `.md`
