## Overview

Kato drops as a **no-cost, mostly keyless** injector—PC and Android builds share the same feather-light DLL, so scripts teleport into RAM in < 3 s. 
A one-week “FREEWEEK” token covers newcomers who want instant API access without loops, then the devs rotate keyless windows every patch cycle. 
Mobile testers rave about Kato’s smooth joystick overlay and tiny CPU footprint, calling it the easiest way to farm from a phone during lunch breaks. 
Behind the scenes, a kernel-level cloak spoofs signatures and hops memory pages, skating past Byfron and Hyperion probes with ninja grace. 
Community chatter on r/robloxhackers praises the slick UI—minimal chrome, neon themes, a single “Play Roblox” button that just *works*. 
The official code repository pushes silent fixes on every launch, so hot patches land before your latte cools.
