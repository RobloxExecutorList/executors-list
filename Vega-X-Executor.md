## Overview

Vega X storms the scene as a **keyless, Level-7 executor** that snaps into Roblox via a feather-light DLL, skipping the tiresome key gates that bog rivals.

Gamers praise its steady frame rates and near-zero crash count, crediting the minimalist UI that stays out of the way when the action spikes. 
Hype isn‚Äôt just marketing‚Äîthe Roblox DevForum lists Vega X among the most detected-resistant mobile executors, forcing server-side scripters to step up their game. 
Safety chatter on Reddit leans positive, noting no shady permissions when sourced straight from the official build.
