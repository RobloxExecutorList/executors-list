## Overview

Built around an external injector that **mimics Hyperion‚Äôs kernel handshake**, Ro-Exec silently lands deep calls such as `getgenv`, `firesignal`, and a full decompiler while anticheat waves slide by unnoticed.

A cloud updater checks offsets at every launch and typically hot-fixes within minutes of a Roblox update, slashing downtime that plagues slower loaders.  Mobile players aren‚Äôt sidelined‚Äîthe Android and side-loaded iOS builds mirror the desktop UI for couch-side exploiting.
